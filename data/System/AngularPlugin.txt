!AngularJS lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter
browser. It lets you use good old HTML (or HAML, Jade and friends!) as your
template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express your
application’s components clearly and succinctly. It automatically synchronizes
data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way
data binding. To help you structure your application better and make it easy to
test, !AngularJS teaches the browser how to do dependency injection and
inversion of control. Oh yeah and it also helps with server-side communication,
taming async callbacks with promises and deferreds; and makes client-side
navigation and deeplinking with hashbang urls or HTML5 pushState a piece of
cake. The best of all: it makes development fun!
